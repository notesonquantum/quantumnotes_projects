## 📁 Projects Overview

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Simulating-Nature` | Demonstrates how quantum computers can simulate molecular systems, using the **Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)** to compute the ground-state energy of H₂ |
| `Quantum-Machine-Learning` | Shows how to build and train a **Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC)** for the XOR problem, from classical to quantum implementation |
| `Deutsch-Jozsa` | Explains and implements the **Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm**, illustrating the efficiency advantage of quantum computation |

More projects will be added over time.
